# DynaMOBS_stress_multisite  
**Multi-site comparison of stress responses in the DynaM-OBS study**  

## Overview  
This repository contains code for analyzing data from the Dynamic Modeling of Resilience Observational (DynaM-OBS) study, which investigates the multimodal stress response across five sites in Europe and Israel. The project evaluates subjective stress ratings, heart rate, salivary cortisol, alpha-amylase, and fMRI BOLD responses using Bayesian inference to assess site-specific effects.  

## Key Features  
- Multi-site analysis of stress responses  
- Bayesian inference for evaluating site effects  
- Analysis of physiological (heart rate, cortisol) and neuroimaging (fMRI BOLD) data  
- Harmonized methods for multisite comparability
